Need bigger FOV to fully take this in! Only brighter stars drawn here. Background looks like the milky way through binoculars.	20180616-04-m24

20180702-04-m21	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 21/Webb's Cross	12:23	8mm	94x	Slight concentration of stars near the center.	20180702-04-m21

Seems brighter and with averted vision sometimes see a small disc around it.  B: position seems more correct, but looks sharper, more star-like. [Yes, confirmed with Stellarium that A is the PN.]	20180711-01-ngc6210
20180711-02-ic4756	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	IC 4756/Graff's Cluster	12:08	25mm	30x	Lots of stars. No concentration. Very pretty. :)	20180711-02-ic4756

20180711-05-m10	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 10	1:16	5mm	150x	Very dim. Stars resolve with averted vision, with direct vision it's just a lighter gray patch	20180711-05-m10
20180711-06-m9	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 9	1:29	5mm	150x	Very faint gray patch. Hint of some stars with averted vision.  Have to shake the telescope to find this. Slight brighter in the core.	20180711-06-m9
20180712-01-m19	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 19	11:05	8mm	94x	Mostly just a faint smudge. Can see hints of stars with averted vision.	20180712-01-m19

20180712-08-m71	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 71/Angelfish Cluster	12:25	8mm	94x	Very faint. Core is not much brighter than the edges. Can see some stars with averted vision. Many faint stars everywhere in the field; too many to sketch	20180712-08-m71
