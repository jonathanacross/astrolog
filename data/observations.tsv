Thebit has a very dark edge on one side, light on the other. Looks deep. Thebit A looks deep but smaller (bowl-shaped?) Thebit L is very small - just a dot.	20181017-01-rupesrecta
20181017-02-delaunay	2018-10-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Delaunay	10:33-10:48	5mm	150x	Delaunay looks like it's cloven in two with a hill/mountain across the middle. Top half is dark gray to gray, and the bottom is gray to light gray.	20181017-02-delaunay

20181018-01-moongammacap	2018-10-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F-P	1	Occulation of Gamma Cep by the Moon	9:35-10:55	25mm	30x	Bright haze all around the moon, can't see the dark side.  At 9:38:43, the star just blinks out, instantly gone.  First detected reappearance at 10:33:14. Couldn't detect that Gamma Cap emerged for probably 20-25 secons from the predicted time since the moon and clouds were so bright. The star was relatively small and dim. Still very cool to see, and the star "moved away" from the moon surprisingly fast.	20181018-01-moongammacap
20181019-01-clavius	2018-10-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Clavius	9:53-10:24	5mm	150x	Clavius has a smooth looking interior, with nice chains of craters inside.	20181019-01-clavius

20181117-02-118tau	2018-11-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F-P	3-	118 Tau	10:37	5mm	150x	Both stars are white. Given the seeing, these go from clearly separated to a single oval blob.	20181117-02-118tau
20181118-01-lambdaori	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	VG	3	Lambda Ori	9:44	25mm	16x	Main feature is a nice right triangle, with a trail of three stars on one edge.	20181118-01-lambdaori

No particular color; white. Can see two 75% complete rings most of the time, with spikes of rings moving around.	20181118-02-gammacet
20181118-03-lambdaori	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Lambda Ori	10:26	5mm	160x	Primary, secondary both white. Close, but cleanly split. Primary maybe 1 mag brighter?	20181118-03-lambdaori
20181118-04-lambdaori	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Lambda Ori	10:42	25mm	30x	Just for fun. Star are bright pinpoints. Very beautiful.	20181118-04-lambdaori
20181118-05-m42trap	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	M 42, Trapezium/Theta1 Ori, Theta2 Ori	10:43	5mm + 2x barlow	300x	Nebula is surprisingly bright and detailed given the moon. Trapezium stars have tiny diffraction rings; can't see any other components (E/F). A treat, but a pain to sketch. Theta2 - both white, similarly bright, though star on the left is the primary.	20181118-05-m42trap

20181119-03-schickard	2018-11-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	2	Schickard	10:44-11:14	5mm	150x	Very star, strong shadows. bottom seemed fairly smooth, but walls are very rough.	20181119-03-schickard
