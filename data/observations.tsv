20180611-03-m12	2018-06-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 12	12:30	5mm	150x		(Compared to M 5) Much fainter. Stars seem more distinct, not as dense.	20180611-03-m12

Need bigger FOV to fully take this in! Only brighter stars drawn here. Background looks like the milky way through binoculars.	20180616-04-m24
20180616-05-m28	2018-06-16	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	P	7	M 28	1:05	8mm	94x		Small globular. Can't resolve any stars. Brighter in the center.	20180616-05-m28

20180702-03-m18	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 18	12:06	12mm	63x		Hard to tell where the boundary of this cluster is. Nice pentagon in the middle. Curious if there would be lots more stars in a darker sky; I don't see many really faint ones.	20180702-03-m18
20180702-04-m21	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 21/Webb's Cross	12:23	8mm	94x		Slight concentration of stars near the center.	20180702-04-m21

Seems brighter and with averted vision sometimes see a small disc around it.  B: position seems more correct, but looks sharper, more star-like. [Yes, confirmed with Stellarium that A is the PN.]	20180711-01-ngc6210
20180711-02-ic4756	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	IC 4756/Graff's Cluster	12:08	25mm	30x		Lots of stars. No concentration. Very pretty. :)	20180711-02-ic4756

20180711-05-m10	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 10	1:16	5mm	150x		Very dim. Stars resolve with averted vision, with direct vision it's just a lighter gray patch	20180711-05-m10
20180711-06-m9	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 9	1:29	5mm	150x		Very faint gray patch. Hint of some stars with averted vision.  Have to shake the telescope to find this. Slight brighter in the core.	20180711-06-m9
20180712-01-m19	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 19	11:05	8mm	94x		Mostly just a faint smudge. Can see hints of stars with averted vision.	20180712-01-m19
20180712-02-m80	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 80	11:21	8mm	94x		Very small, bright core. However with averted vision can see it's quite large and diffuse at the edges. I like this one! :)	20180712-02-m80
20180712-03-betasco	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Beta Sco	11:29	8mm	94x		Both stars are bright white. Primary is quite bright. Easy split.	20180712-03-betasco
20180712-04-m28	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 28	11:41	8mm	94x		Brighter core. Only the faintest hint of any stars with averted vision; mostly a smudge.	20180712-04-m28
20180712-05-m8	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 8/Lagoon Nebula	11:49	8mm	94x		Nice open cluster; a few bright stars and many very faint ones. Some slight nebulosity visible next to the star on the left.  Not as impressive as at the darker site, but still pretty cool.	20180712-05-m8
20180712-06-m21	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 21/Webb's Cross	11:59	8mm	94x		Very open cluster. Not too many stars.	20180712-06-m21

20180712-08-m71	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 71/Angelfish Cluster	12:25	8mm	94x		Very faint. Core is not much brighter than the edges. Can see some stars with averted vision. Many faint stars everywhere in the field; too many to sketch	20180712-08-m71

With 8mm EP, this was even more striking, where it would almost completely disappear with straight vision and get very bright with averted vision. Very cool. :)	20180807-01-ngc6826

With more averted vision can see 3 stars, can't see if there are any more.	20180901-03-m73

Thebit has a very dark edge on one side, light on the other. Looks deep. Thebit A looks deep but smaller (bowl-shaped?) Thebit L is very small - just a dot.	20181017-01-rupesrecta

Still very cool to see, and the star "moved away" from the moon surprisingly fast.	20181018-01-moongammacap
