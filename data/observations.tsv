Need bigger FOV to fully take this in! Only brighter stars drawn here. Background looks like the milky way through binoculars.	20180616-04-m24
20180616-05-m28	2018-06-16	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	P	7	M 28	1:05	8mm	94x		Small globular. Can't resolve any stars. Brighter in the center.	20180616-05-m28

20180702-03-m18	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 18	12:06	12mm	63x		Hard to tell where the boundary of this cluster is. Nice pentagon in the middle. Curious if there would be lots more stars in a darker sky; I don't see many really faint ones.	20180702-03-m18
20180702-04-m21	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 21/Webb's Cross	12:23	8mm	94x		Slight concentration of stars near the center.	20180702-04-m21

Seems brighter and with averted vision sometimes see a small disc around it.  B: position seems more correct, but looks sharper, more star-like. [Yes, confirmed with Stellarium that A is the PN.]	20180711-01-ngc6210
20180711-02-ic4756	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	IC 4756/Graff's Cluster	12:08	25mm	30x		Lots of stars. No concentration. Very pretty. :)	20180711-02-ic4756

20180711-05-m10	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 10	1:16	5mm	150x		Very dim. Stars resolve with averted vision, with direct vision it's just a lighter gray patch	20180711-05-m10
20180711-06-m9	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 9	1:29	5mm	150x		Very faint gray patch. Hint of some stars with averted vision.  Have to shake the telescope to find this. Slight brighter in the core.	20180711-06-m9
20180712-01-m19	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 19	11:05	8mm	94x		Mostly just a faint smudge. Can see hints of stars with averted vision.	20180712-01-m19
20180712-02-m80	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 80	11:21	8mm	94x		Very small, bright core. However with averted vision can see it's quite large and diffuse at the edges. I like this one! :)	20180712-02-m80
20180712-03-betasco	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Beta Sco	11:29	8mm	94x		Both stars are bright white. Primary is quite bright. Easy split.	20180712-03-betasco

With 8mm EP, this was even more striking, where it would almost completely disappear with straight vision and get very bright with averted vision. Very cool. :)	20180807-01-ngc6826

With more averted vision can see 3 stars, can't see if there are any more.	20180901-03-m73

Still very cool to see, and the star "moved away" from the moon surprisingly fast.	20181018-01-moongammacap
